# Kawahagi Sashimi & Kimo

Kawahagi is thread-sail filefish, which has pretty hard skin. Therefore, you need peel off whenever you cook, which is the origin of the word Kawa (skin) Hagi (peel).

Kawahagi's liver is very tasty as well, which you can see in the middle of sashimi. It's also called Foie gras of the ocean.
